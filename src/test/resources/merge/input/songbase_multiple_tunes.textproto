lyrics: "### Original tune\n# Capo 3\n\n1\n[G]A little [D7]bird I [G]am,\nShut [C]from the fields of [D]air,[D7]\nAnd [G]in my [D7]cage I [G]sit and sing\nTo [A]Him who [A7]placed me [D]there;\n[D7]Well [G]pleased a prisoner to be,\nBecause, [D]my [G]God[C], it [D]pleas[D7]eth [G]Thee.\n\n2\nNought have I else to do,\nI sing the whole day long;\nAnd He whom most I love to please\nDoth listen to my song;\nHe caught and bound my wandering wing,\nBut still He bends to hear me sing.\n\n3\nThou hast an ear to hear\nA heart to love and bless;\nAnd though my notes were e'er so rude,\nThou wouldst not hear the less;\nBecause Thou knowest as they fall,\nThat love, sweet love, inspires them all.\n\n4\nMy cage confines me round;\nAbroad I cannot fly;\nBut though my wing is closely bound,\nMy heart's at liberty;\nFor prison walls cannot control\nThe flight, the freedom of the soul.\n\n5\nO it is good to soar\nThese bolts and bars above!\nTo Him whose purpose I adore,\nWhose providence I love;\nAnd in Thy mighty will to find\nThe joy, the freedom of the mind.\n\n### Tune 2\n1\n[D]A little [G]bird I am,\nShut [D]from the [Bm]fields of [A]air,\n[D]And in my [G]cage I sit and [D]sing\nTo Him who placed me [A]there;\n[G]Well pleased a [A]prisoner to [F#m  Bm]be,\n[G]Because, my [A]God, it [A7]pleaseth [D]Thee.\n\n2\nNought have I else to do,\nI sing the whole day long;\nAnd He whom most I love to please\nDoth listen to my song;\nHe caught and bound my wandering wing,\nBut still He bends to hear me sing.\n\n3\nThou hast an ear to hear\nA heart to love and bless;\nAnd though my notes were e'er so rude,\nThou wouldst not hear the less;\nBecause Thou knowest as they fall,\nThat love, sweet love, inspires them all.\n\n4\nMy cage confines me round;\nAbroad I cannot fly;\nBut though my wing is closely bound,\nMy heart's at liberty;\nFor prison walls cannot control\nThe flight, the freedom of the soul.\n\n5\nO it is good to soar\nThese bolts and bars above!\nTo Him whose purpose I adore,\nWhose providence I love;\nAnd in Thy mighty will to find\nThe joy, the freedom of the mind.\n\n### Tune 3\n# Capo 4\n\n1\nA [C]little [G]bird I [Am]am,\nShut [F]from the fields of [G]air,\nAnd [C]in my [G]cage I [Am]sit and sing\nTo [F]Him who placed me [G]there;\nWell pleased [C]a [G]priso[Am]ner to be,\nBe[F]cause, my [G]God, it pleaseth [C-F-C]Thee.\n\n2\nNought have I else to do,\nI sing the whole day long;\nAnd He whom most I love to please\nDoth listen to my song;\nHe caught and bound my wandering wing,\nBut still He bends to hear me sing.\n\n3\nThou hast an ear to hear\nA heart to love and bless;\nAnd though my notes were e'er so rude,\nThou wouldst not hear the less;\nBecause Thou knowest as they fall,\nThat love, sweet love, inspires them all.\n\n4\nMy cage confines me round;\nAbroad I cannot fly;\nBut though my wing is closely bound,\nMy heart's at liberty;\nFor prison walls cannot control\nThe flight, the freedom of the soul.\n\n5\nO it is good to soar\nThese bolts and bars above!\nTo Him whose purpose I adore,\nWhose providence I love;\nAnd in Thy mighty will to find\nThe joy, the freedom of the mind."
